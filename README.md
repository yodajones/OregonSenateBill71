==================

Oregon Senate Bill 71 might impact RC modelers and stifle a emerging technology by over regulation.  Help us stop it.

I am a RC (radio controlled) model hobbyist.  In the last couple years I discovered the fun of flying first RC helicopters and then what are called "multirotors" or "quadcopters", I also started flying RC airplanes.
Many RC modelers, including the RC car and truck guys, enjoy attaching a still or video camera to their models for the purpose of taking ground and/or aerial photos and videos.  It is a lot of fun seeing the point of view from a radio controlled model car or airplane and sharing them with friends and family.

Some of our Oregon, and recently other state representatives as well, have begun pushing legislature that could very likely cause some of these RC hobbyists activities to become illegal.  In my mind the people proposing these new bills probably have good intentions for protecting the privacy of it's citizens but have chosen some unfortunate wording that is quite broad and could have a negative impact on many hobbyists.

Senator Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, Oregon has been quoted as saying "The last thing I think people want to do is look outside their picture window or their bedroom window and see a drone,".  Who does?  I may be mistaken, but don't we already have laws about peering into peoples windows?

I find the word "Drone" is being used frequently and it makes sense that when the uninitiated hear the word Drone they think of evil science fiction or militarized machines.  This is expected when the media more often than not presents content that are related to various war efforts.

It would be a shame if Senators with good intentions created laws that would hinder the development of a active hobbyist community.  It is exactly these hobbyists that we have to thank for much of the technology we use and take for granted every single day.

Due to the wording of Oregon SB-71 many children's toys could become illegal, including the iPad/iPod controlled AR Drone, could be illegal.

I'm posting this GitHub repository with the hopes that other modelers and professionals will get involved and help get Oregon State Senate Bill 71 changed into something that protects the privacy of the citizenry but will not make it illegal for hobbyists to pursue and further develop this cool new technology.
